flickrUpload
============

Yet another FlickrUpload tool built in ruby.

This was a learning project and is still a work in progress (see TODO). I wanted to push all my photos to Flickr automatically but didn't want to buy a program to do it.

I took some design ideas from other Flickr gems [Flickraw](https://github.com/hanklords/flickraw) but mainly I wanted to learn how to build this type of API integration myself.

TODO:

+ USE CLASSES!
+ Pull already uploaded images after page 1 API
+ Be able to upload images after page 1 from the API
+ Cache the image names already pulled previously so we don't re-upload
+ Need a way to handle edits that occur online

Please leave feedback if you have any!
